## üöÄ Overview

This is a secure Model Context Protocol (MCP) server implementation that provides controlled filesystem access for AI models. It allows Large Language Models to securely read, write, and manipulate files within explicitly defined allowed directories.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT SECURITY NOTICE**: Compiled executables are intentionally not included in this repository. Users should always review the source code and compile it themselves to ensure security. Never run precompiled executables from untrusted sources when dealing with filesystem access.

This project is a Go implementation of the original [Filesystem MCP server](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/tree/main/src/filesystem) from the Model Context Protocol project developed by Anthropic.

## üìÅ Repository

This project is part of the [PUBLIC-Golang-MCP-Servers](https://github.com/LaurieRhodes/PUBLIC-Golang-MCP-Servers) repository, which contains various MCP server implementations in Go.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Security-First Design**: Comprehensive path validation and containment
- **Multiple Directory Support**: Configure multiple allowed directories
- **Comprehensive Tools**:
  - Read and write files securely
  - Create and list directories
  - Move/rename files and directories
  - Search for files matching patterns
  - Get detailed file metadata
- **Robust Error Handling**: Detailed error messages for troubleshooting
- **Configuration**: Simple JSON-based configuration

## üîí Security

Security is a primary focus of this implementation:

- **Strict Path Validation**: Prevents access outside allowed directories
- **Symlink Protection**: Ensures symlinks don't lead outside allowed directories
- **Path Normalization**: Consistent security checks to prevent path traversal attacks
- **Parent Directory Validation**: Verifies parent directories of files being created

## üß∞ Available Tools

| Tool Name                  | Description                          |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `read_file`                | Read the complete contents of a file |
| `read_multiple_files`      | Read multiple files at once          |
| `write_file`               | Create or overwrite a file           |
| `create_directory`         | Create a new directory               |
| `list_directory`           | List contents of a directory         |
| `move_file`                | Move or rename files and directories |
| `search_files`             | Search for files matching a pattern  |
| `get_file_info`            | Get metadata about a file            |
| `list_allowed_directories` | List all allowed directories         |

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

The server uses a `config.json` file which should be placed in the same directory as the executable or in the current working directory:

```json
{
  "allowedDirectories": [
    "C:\\Users\\Username\\AppData\\Roaming\\Claude",
    "C:\\Users\\Username\\Documents",
    "D:\\Projects"
  ]
}
```

If the `config.json` file doesn't exist, a default one will be created with the current directory as the allowed directory.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.21 or higher
- Basic understanding of MCP architecture

### Building from Source

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/LaurieRhodes/PUBLIC-Golang-MCP-Servers.git
cd PUBLIC-Golang-MCP-Servers/MCP-FileSystem-Golang

# Build the server
go build -o filesystem-mcp ./cmd/server

# Run the server (will use config.json)
./filesystem-mcp
```

### MCP Client Configuration

In your MCP client configuration, set up the filesystem server like this:

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "filesystem": {
      "command": "C:\\path\\to\\filesystem-mcp.exe",
      "args": []
    }
  }
}
```

Note that unlike the Node.js version, allowed directories are specified in the `config.json` file, not as command-line arguments.

## üìä Implementation Details

This server is built with Go and follows the Model Context Protocol specifications:

- **Transport**: Uses stdio for communication (reading JSON-RPC messages from stdin and writing responses to stdout)
- **Modular Design**: Clean separation between MCP protocol handling and filesystem operations
- **Comprehensive Error Handling**: Detailed error messages for easier debugging

}
```

### write_file

```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "path": {
      "type": "string"
    },
    "content": {
      "type": "string"
    }
  },
  "required": ["path", "content"]
}
```
